Task0:

Runtime: O(1)

This is a constant time algorithm. It had two lines of code. 

Task1: 

Runtime: O(2n + 1) * 2 = O(2n) = O(n)

This is an N time algorithm. It had two for loops, but constants can be removed. 

Task2: 

Runtime: O(n + 6) + O(2) + O(n + 3) = O(n)

This is an N time algorithm. It used two seperate loops. 

Task3 Part A:

Runtime: O(n + 13) + O(n log(n))= O(n log(n))

This is an N log N time algorithm because of sorting the list. 

Task3 Part B:

Runtime: O(n + 3) = O(n)

This is an N time algorithm because I had one loop

Task 4: 

Runtime: O(n + 2) + O(n + 4) + O(n + 2) + O(n log(n)) = O(n log(n))

This is an N log N time algorithm because of sorting the list.
